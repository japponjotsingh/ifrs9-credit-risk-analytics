## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud Platform account (free tier available)
- Basic understanding of SQL and credit risk concepts

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ifrs9-automation.git
cd ifrs9-automation
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Generate Sample Data
```bash
python generate_sample_data.py
```

This creates `loan_portfolio_data.csv` with 5,000 synthetic loans.

### Step 4: Set Up Google Cloud Platform

1. **Create GCP Project:**
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Create new project: "ifrs9-analytics"
   - Enable BigQuery API

2. **Create Service Account:**
   - Navigate to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
   - Create account with "BigQuery Admin" role
   - Download JSON key

3. **Set Authentication:**
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/key.json"
   ```

### Step 5: Load Data to BigQuery

1. Edit `setup_bigquery.py` with your Project ID
2. Run setup:
   ```bash
   python setup_bigquery.py
   ```

### Step 6: Run Analytics Queries

Access BigQuery Console and run queries from `sql_queries.sql`:

**Example - Portfolio Summary:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ifrs9_stage,
    COUNT(*) as loan_count,
    ROUND(SUM(outstanding_balance), 2) as total_exposure,
    ROUND(SUM(ecl_amount), 2) as total_ecl,
    ROUND(SUM(ecl_amount)/SUM(outstanding_balance)*100, 2) as coverage_pct
FROM `your-project-id.credit_risk_ifrs9.loan_portfolio`
GROUP BY ifrs9_stage
ORDER BY ifrs9_stage;
```

## 📊 Python Analysis (Vertex AI)

### Running the Analysis

The project includes a comprehensive Python notebook for advanced analytics:

**File:** `ifrs9_plotly_notebook.py`

**What it does:**
- Fetches loan data from BigQuery
- Performs portfolio risk analysis
- Creates 6 interactive Plotly visualizations:
  - IFRS 9 staging distribution (pie + bar charts)
  - Product risk analysis (ECL rates by product)
  - Credit quality distribution (4-panel analysis)
  - Correlation heatmap (risk metric relationships)
  - Vintage analysis (performance by origination year)
  - Geographic distribution (risk by region)
- Exports analysis results to CSV

**To run:**
1. Upload notebook to Vertex AI Workbench or local Jupyter
2. Update `PROJECT_ID` on line 33
3. Run all cells
4. View interactive charts and export files

**Requirements:**
```python
google-cloud-bigquery
pandas
plotly
```

**Outputs:**
- `portfolio_summary.csv` - Overall portfolio metrics
- `high_risk_watchlist.csv` - Stage 3 and high ECL loans
- `product_risk_analysis.csv` - Risk metrics by product type
